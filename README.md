## Description

### Why did I build this?

I built a password manager in Python, which took me 6 hours to complete.

### Why?

After being hacked on multiple accounts over the course of 2 years, and trying various methods to prevent it, such as 2FA, I thought it might be due to my password manager, as it was free.

### Where is all my data saved?

Your data is saved in a file named `passwords.json`, and it is stored in the directory where you launched the Python file.

# How to Use - Windows

## First Step

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) on your device.
2. Test that you have installed Python:
```
python --version
pip --version
```


If there is no output, restart your device. If there is now an output, proceed to the next step!

## Second Step

If you want an executable (`.exe`), you need to install [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/) and [pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/).

To install `pyperclip`:
```
pip install pyperclip
```

If you don't want to create an executable, you can launch the program with:
```
python ./main.py
```


If you want to create an executable, execute these two commands:
```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile ./main.py
```
